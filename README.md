## üåÜ The Urban Challenge

In India's rapidly growing cities, traffic intersections have become critical bottlenecks, where:
* Average commuters lose 2-3 hours daily in traffic congestion
* Conventional timer-based systems fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns
* Manual traffic management is inconsistent and resource-intensive
* Vehicle emissions from idling contribute significantly to urban air pollution

Smart Flow transforms these painpoints into opportunities for creating smarter, more efficient urban mobility.

Unlike traditional systems, Smart Flow:
* **Sees** traffic conditions in real-time through computer vision
* **Learns** from historical patterns using reinforcement learning
* **Adapts** signal timings dynamically to optimize flow
* **Coordinates** across multiple intersections for network-wide efficiency
